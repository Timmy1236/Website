I've always been interested in creating digital art related to music or drawing, but honestly, I never had much talent for that. All my creativity and inventions have always been limited to simply writing lines of code. I don't have much to tell you about myself right now, as I'm focused on finishing all my projects in progress. So, thanks for visiting my page, which will remain in development forever. (`･ω･´)",
